News Management System using C++ and Data Structures


The News Management System is a comprehensive software project implemented in C++ that empowers users to personalize their news consumption, engage with articles through ratings and comments, and provides administrators with efficient tools for managing news content.

Key Features:

    User Preferences: The system allows users to customize their news experience by selecting their preferred categories. Users can choose from a predefined set of categories or add new categories as needed.

    Category-based News Viewing: Users can easily access news articles assigned to their preferred categories. The system provides a user-friendly interface to view articles from specific categories, ensuring a personalized and relevant news feed.

    Rating and Commenting: Users can rate and provide comments on each news article they read. This feature promotes user engagement and facilitates discussion and feedback on articles.

    Spam Reporting: To maintain the integrity of the news platform, users have the ability to report articles as spam if they encounter any inappropriate or misleading content. This helps administrators in moderating the news content effectively.

    User Management: The system allows administrators to view and manage user accounts. They can perform actions such as deleting users, modifying user privileges, and monitoring user activities.

    News Management: Administrators have full control over the news content. They can add new articles, assign them to appropriate categories, and delete outdated or irrelevant news articles. This ensures the platform stays up-to-date with the latest information.

    User Ratings and Average Ratings: The system provides insights into user ratings for each article, allowing administrators to analyze user preferences and the popularity of articles. It also calculates and displays the average ratings for every article.

    Article Addition: Administrators can add new articles to the system, ensuring a continuous flow of fresh and relevant content.
